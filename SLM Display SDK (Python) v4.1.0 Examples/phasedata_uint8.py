# Show monochrome phase data calculated using 8-bit integer values from 0 to 255.
# Calculates phase values for a blazed grating with a period of 77 pixel.
# We only need to calculate one period for the grating on the CPU, since the
# grating is a repetition of the period. When the grating is aligned to the
# pixel of the SLM, HOLOEYE SLM Display SDK can do the replication very fast
# on the GPU during rendering. The default show flag HEDSSHF_PresentAutomatic
# would figure out that the data has a size of only one pixel in one direction
# and would treat it as a grating anyway, but for demonstration purpose we pass
# the show flag HEDSSHF_PresentTiledCentered manually, which enforces the
# replication during rendering.
